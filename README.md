# Staff Restrictor
Staff Restrictor is an addon that allows you to block certain commands from jobs. Meaning admins cannot use them while off-duty! Note this only supports ULX for the moment. Working on getting it ported to FAdmin as well.

# Features
- Extremely Lightweight (Took me less than a day)
-ULX Support
- API to allow you to hook into the addon's functions
- Customise all text
- Stop's the commands running at all.

# Support
Addon support is given on my website. IT WILL NOT BE GIVEN ANYWHERE ELSE.
